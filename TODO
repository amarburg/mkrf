* install task for output Rakefile
* command-line configuration options

BUGS
* Fix libpath (shouldn't default to /usr/local/lib)


From Tim Hunter:

I'm trying to write a Rakefile for RMagick with mkrf. The first thing I miss is the equivalent of autoconf's AC_CHECK_PROGS. I think this is the find_executable method in mkmf

It would also be nice to have some kind of automatic option processing for --with-THING, --without-THING, --enable-THING, --disable-THING options.

Two more things.

1) How do I add arbitrary strings to the gcc options such as the values of LDFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, and CFLAGS?

A) For now, users may modify them directly via the objs and cflags accessors.

2) RMagick uses about 100 feature test symbols (HAVE_xxx, etc.), too many to specify on the command line. It must be possible to create a configuration header file from a template, like the file created by AC_CONFIG_HEADERS.
