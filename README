= mkrf -- making C extensions for Ruby a bit easier

<tt>mkrf</tt> is intended to replace <tt>mkmf</tt> which is a library for building
Makefiles to build C extensions to Ruby. The major differences between the two is
that +mkrf+ builds you a Rakefile instead of a Makefile, and also that +mkrf+
provides an object-oriented interface.

Major goals of mkrf are
* easy code reuse of its <tt>Availability</tt> class and
* simple, well documented, use of the <tt>Generator</tt> class.

== Basic Usage

<tt>mkrf</tt> works similarly to <tt>mkmf</tt> in that a user writes an
extension configuration file (usually named <tt>extconf.rb</tt>) and then runs
it (<tt>ruby ./extconf.rb</tt>), which generates a <tt>Rakefile</tt> in the
current directory.

In general, <tt>extconf.rb</tt> should be placed in the root directory of the 
extension (ex. <tt>PROJECT_ROOT/ext/<i>name_of_module</i></tt>) and it expects,
by default, that files to be compiled have a <tt>.c</tt> extension and reside in
that same directory. If your project contains multiple extension modules, then
each one would get its own subdirectory under <tt>PROJECT_ROOT/ext/</tt> and
have its own <tt>extconf.rb</tt> file.

The most basic usage looks like the following, where the name of the extension
module being built is "libtrivial":

  require 'mkrf'
  Mkrf::Generator.new('libtrivial')

Extra arguments may be passed to the Rakefile generator in a block:
  
  Mkrf::Generator.new('libtrivial') do |g|
    g.logger.level = Logger::WARN
    g.include_library('z')
  end

Another example:

  Mkrf::Generator.new('libxml') do |g|
    g.include_library('socket','socket')
    g.include_header('libxml/xmlversion.h', 
                     '/opt/include/libxml2', 
                     '/usr/local/include/libxml2', 
                     '/usr/include/libxml2')
  end
