= mkrf -- making C extensions for Ruby a bit easier

<tt>mkrf</tt> is intended to replace <tt>mkmf</tt>, a library for buildling
Makefiles to build C extensions to Ruby. Its major goals are easy code reuse of
its <tt>Availability</tt> class and simple, well documented, use of the
<tt>Generator</tt> class for Rakefile generation for extensions.

== Basic Usage

<tt>mkrf</tt> works similarly to <tt>mkmf</tt> in that a user writes an
extension configuration (usually <tt>extconf.rb</tt>) and then runs it, which
generates a <tt>Rakefile</tt>. 

In general, <tt>extconf.rb</tt> should be placed in the root directory of the 
extension and it expects by default that files to be compiled have a <tt>.c</tt> 
extension and are in the <tt>lib/</tt> directory.

The most basic usage looks like this, with the name of the library to be linked
as the first argument to <tt>Mkrf::Generator.new</tt>:

  require 'mkrf'
  Mkrf::Generator.new('libtrivial_so.bundle')

Extra arguments may be passed to the generator in a block:

  Mkrf::Generator.new('libxml_so.bundle', '*.c') do |g|
    g.include_library('socket','socket')
    g.include_header('libxml/xmlversion.h', 
                     '/opt/include/libxml2', 
                     '/usr/local/include/libxml2', 
                     '/usr/include/libxml2')
  end

If the extension does not follow the source in <tt>lib/</tt> / <tt>.c</tt> 
extension convention, it may be overridden in the constructor:

  Mkrf::Generator.new('syck.bundle', '*.c') do |g|
    g.include_header("st.h")
  end
